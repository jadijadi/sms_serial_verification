# sms_verification
This project is done for Altech as a educational series.

## How to run
1. Install python3, pip3, virtualenv, MySQL in your system.
2. Clone the project `https://github.com/jadijadi/sms_serial_verification && cd sms_serial_verification`
3. rename the `config.py.sample` to `config.py` and do proper changes.
4. db configs are in config.py, but you also need to add this table to the database manually:
`CREATE TABLE PROCESSED_SMS (status ENUM('OK', 'FAILURE', 'DOUBLE', 'NOT-FOUND'), sender CHAR(20), message VARCHAR(400), answer VARCHAR(400), date DATETIME INDEX(date, status));`
5. Create a virtualenve named build using `virtualenv -p python3 build`
6. Connect to virtualenv using `source build/bin/activate`
7. Install packages using `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
8. Now environment is ready run it using `python3 app/main.py`

### Or you can use Dockerfile to deploy it to docker
